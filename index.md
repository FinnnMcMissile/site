## About me.

I’ve been with Security Watchdog since January 2017, where I initially provided triage and support to internal and external clients, deployed updates to our web apps, and played a key role in the change control process. Over time, my role evolved into managing and optimizing our Core Platform, which supports multiple businesses within Matrix Security Watchdog. My experience spans across Azure, Linux VMs, SQL databases, and a wide array of other tools and services crucial to maintaining a secure, stable, and high-performing infrastructure.

In my current role as a Senior DevOps Engineer, I lead the efforts to ensure the platform is not only operational 24x7x365 but also continuously improving to meet the demands of our growing businesses. I work closely with Technical Architects, manage expectations with key stakeholders, and mentor junior engineers, all while driving automation, enhancing security, and ensuring that our systems scale seamlessly to handle increasing throughput.
